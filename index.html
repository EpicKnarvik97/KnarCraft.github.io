    <h1>KnarCraft temporary info site</h1>
    <h2>The KnarCraft server's motherboard started having problems some weeks ago.
    The hardware has been sent back to the retailer, but it has taken much longer than expected.
    This temporary site only exists to tell you that KnarCraft isn't down for good,
      it's only down until the server's up and running again.</h2>
